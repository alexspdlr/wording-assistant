## Run Locally

I advise against trying to run the project locally, but if you want to try so anyways, make sure the correct chromium version is installed.

#### Step-by-step: 

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
